Getting to know GIT


Remote repo - version of code stored remotely "working version of code"

Local repo - a version of the remote repo that you are individually working on

GIT History - tracks commits (Changes to code or checkpoints) this is done first locally then they are pushed to the remote repo

Commits - this is done first locally then they are 'pushed' to the remote repo

pull - pulls changes (or commits) from remote repo to your local repo

push - pushes changes to the branch you are working on

Branches - master branch is most up to date working version of code, branches store and track commits allowing you to see changes or role back to older iterations of the code. secondary branchs allows you to work on code without affecting master branch until you are sure your code is properly working once this is complete you can merge the branches allowing them to work coherently. can still pull changes from master branch to secondary

conflicts - if you run into a conflict error when pushing your changes from the local to remote you need to pull changes from the remote first you will then get a message asking you to fix conflicts. the file will have error messages delete and make file how you want then commit + pushwork flow > add > commit > push > conflict > pull > fix > add > commit > push
