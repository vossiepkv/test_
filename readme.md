# this repo was a test to get myself familiar with using GIT, i practiced creating a repo, pulling, pushing, creating branches, mergeing, adding and commiting. i have created some documentation which i will include of the note i have taken if i ever need to access them again, if anyone does find them and would like to use them as a quick guide you're more then welcome too. Enjoy!
